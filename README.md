# Game-Theory-Simulation
This is a simulation of basic game theory principles in Python. I plan to update this so that it includes deletion of dots (players). In addition, a future idea will include unique learning methods to account for memory of past interactions.

I would also like to acknowledge that I did, in fact, use ChatGPT 3.5 to help troubleshoot coding errors and improve efficencies in production.

This idea is not created by ChatGPT, it is my own idea and interest to create a game theory simulation in Python.
