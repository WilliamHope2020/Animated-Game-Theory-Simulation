# Game-Theory-Simulation
This is a simulation of basic game theory principles in Python. A future idea will fix the ending output for player strategies and change the "dot" syntax to "player". Additionally, more featurse will be added in accordance to realistic game theory mechanics.

This simulation is a graphical representation to aid those who want to understand game theory. In this simulation, dots are considered players, where they interact with each other as they move around the chart in a random manner. As these dots interact, they automatically play "games" where they compete, either cooperating, defecting, or taking advantage of each other.

Currently, this new version has features such as adding new dots (competitors), removing dots where size = 0 (bankruptcy), antitrust scrutiny policy (when a dot's size is too big), and when a dot is twice the size of another dot, it consumes that dot's size. If you are curious about the implications of this simulation, it is meant to be a realistic representation to how game theory is in every day life. 

I would also like to acknowledge that I did, in fact, use ChatGPT 3.5 to help troubleshoot coding errors and improve efficiencies in production.

This idea is not created by ChatGPT, it is my own idea and interest to create a game theory simulation in Python.
