# Game-Theory-Simulation
This is a simulation of basic game theory principles in Python. Future ideas will attempt to include more features in accordance to realistic game theory mechanics.

This simulation is a graphical representation to aid those who want to understand game theory. In this simulation, players interact with each other as they move around the chart in a semi-random manner. As these players interact, they automatically play "games" where they compete, either cooperating, defecting, or sabotage. Currently I am trying to fix the chart placement.

Currently, this new version has features such as adding new players (competitors), removing players where size = 0 (bankruptcy), antitrust scrutiny policy (when a player's size is too big), and when a player is twice the size of another player, it consumes that player's size. Other features are stock market crashes (put at 3%), recessions and depressions (put at 1%), which are currently treated as rare macroeconomic events, in which players are independent of these events occurring. If you are curious about the implications of this simulation, it is meant to be a realistic representation to how game theory is in every day life. 

I would also like to acknowledge that I did, in fact, use ChatGPT 3.5 to help troubleshoot coding errors and improve efficiencies in production.

This idea is not created by ChatGPT, it is my own idea and interest to create a game theory simulation in Python.
